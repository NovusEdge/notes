## Voltage, Current and Resistance

There are 2 quantities that we like to keep track of in electronic circuits: 
- Voltage
- Current

These quantities are _time-dependant_, that is, they change with respect to time. Before we proceed, we need to define these terms:

#### Voltage

***Definition***: The Voltage (_potential difference_ or _electromotive force_) between 2 points is the amount of work need to move a unit of electric charge in an electrostatic field, from one point to another.

The unit of measure is _volt_ expressed as $V$. A joule ($J$) of work is done in moving a coulomb ($C$) of  charge through potential difference of 1 $V$. 
$$1\ C = charge\ on\ 6*10^{18}\ electrons$$

#### Current

***Definition*** Current is the rate of flow of electric charge per unit time.

The unit of measure is ampere ($A$ or $C/s$).

$$I\ =\ \frac{Q}{t}$$
Here, ` I ` is the electric current, ` Q ` is the Charge in coloumbs, and ` t ` is the time. One ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge per second.  

$$1\ A\ =\ \frac{1\ C}{1\ sec}$$
**NOTE**: By convention, current in a circuit is considered to flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, i.e. the direction opposite to the direction of flow of electrons.
