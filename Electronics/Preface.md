This collection of notes will mainly revolve around the book: [[Bibliography#^03854b|Art of Electronics]]. So, each chapter will have it's own directory with a collection of notes in each. 

I will also be using more resources and references, all of which can be found in the [[Bibliography]] file. I wish you luck on your journey with learning hardware and electronics, and hope that this collection of notes is useful.
