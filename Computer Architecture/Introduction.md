In the name of Allah, The Creator, The Destroyer

These notes will use the book: [[Bibliography#^b109f3|Computer Systems: A Programmerâ€™s Perspective 2nd edition by Bryant and O'Hallaron]] as the main foundation.

The authors don't really mention much in the introduction for the book, just a bunch of history and trivia and information about themselves.

It is important to note that the subject of computer architecture requires you to have some prerequisites of how computers work as well as some experience with C and assembly programming. Furthermore, you'll also need some math to follow through, so if you don't fulfill these, I would highly recommend that you go and study the above mentioned topics first.
