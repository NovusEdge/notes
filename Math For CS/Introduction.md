### Key Takeaways
1. A proof is a _method of establishing truth._
2.  Like beauty, “truth” sometimes depends on the eye of the beholder, and it should not be surprising that what constitutes a proof differs among field.
3. Proofs also play a growing role in computer science; they are used to certify that software and hardware will always behave correctly, something that no amount of testing can do.

There's a very important footnote in this section stating:

> Actually, only scientific _falsehood_ can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted. But no amount of experiment can confirm that the _next_ experiment won’t fail. For this reason, scientists rarely speak of truth, but rather of _theories_ that accurately predict past, and anticipated future, experiments.

Mathematics has it's own notion of "proof":

***Definition***: A [[Chapter 1#What is a Proof|_mathematical proof_]] of a _[[Chapter 1#Prepositions|proposition]]_ is a chain of _logical deductions_ leading to the proposition from a base set of _axioms_.

The section further mentions:

- [[Chapter 1|`Chapter 1`]] examines these three ideas along with some basic ways of organizing proofs
- [[Chapter 2|`Chapter 2`]] introduces the Well Ordering Principle, a basic method of proof.
- [[Chapter 5|`Chapter 5`]] introduces the closely related proof method of induction.
