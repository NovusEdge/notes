Here are some key takeaways from [[Bibliography#^9c2cde|Mathematics for Computer Science]]'s `Introduction` Section:

1. A proof is a _method of establishing truth._
2.  Like beauty, “truth” sometimes depends on the eye of the beholder, and it should not be surprising that what constitutes a proof differs among field.
3. Proofs also play a growing role in computer science; they are used to certify that software and hardware will always behave correctly, something that no amount of testing can do.

There's a very important footnote in this section stating:

> Actually, only scientific _falsehood_ can be demonstrated by an experiment—when the experiment fails to behave as predicted. But no amount of experiment can confirm that the _next_ experiment won’t fail. For this reason, scientists rarely speak of truth, but rather of _theories_ that accurately predict past, and anticipated future, experiments.

Mathematics has it's own notion of "proof":

***Definition***: A _[[Proofs#What is a Proof|mathematical proof]]_ of a _[[Proofs#Prepositions|proposition]]_ is a chain of _[[Proofs#Logical Deductions|logical deductions]]_ leading to the proposition from a base set of _[[Proofs#The Axiomatic Method|axioms]]_.
